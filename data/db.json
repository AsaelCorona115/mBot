    "lessonPresentation": "For this lesson let's review the software tools that would be used during this project including: mBlock, Arudino Mode, Arduino C. In this section of the project we would give a brief introduction to Scratch as a language, why it is easy to use and the different types of blocks that can be used in it to program different things. Here we would explain how to install mBlock, what version, from where and how to install it. We would include an introduction to the different type of blocks available in Scratch that are compatible with the mBot. However, the individual blocks explanation wouldn't go much into detail since each block would be better understood if its use is explained at the moment of using it, that way new users can see its practical application rather than only theoretical. Additionally, explaining what is Arduino mode and why it is useful would be included in this section of the project. Lastly, this section of the course would include how to connect your mBot to your computer and how to restore it to its original firmware if you wish to connect it to your cellphone. ",

    "lessonPresentation":"Now that we are starting to get familiar with the mBot and how to communicate with it to tell it how to use its built-in-speaker and LED lights, we are going to use a new component of the mBot and our first sensor: the light sensor. Using the light sensor to detect how the levels of light at a certain moment, we are going to program the mBot to turn on its lights and make sounds, an emergency mBot! While doing this lesson, we'll learn about conditionals,for loops, means, how to read information from a sensor and how to use that information in our programs. ",

    "lessonRequirements": ["speaker", "led", "light_sensor"],
    "lessonAnalysis":"The mBot has a light sensor on top of its circuit board that can be used to measure the level of light available around the robot. It returns a value in the range of 0-1024. However, these levels vary depending on the moment and room. For this reason, before we use the readings from the sensor, we have to calculate the mean of the readings. To do this, we are going to take 10 measurements of the light level each second and calculate its mean to determine the mean level of light. If the light varies from that level, then will tell the mBot to turn on its lights and make sound to work as a blackout alarm. ",

",
    "lessonPresentation":"Now that we have dominated a few components and sensors is time to start teaching the mBot how to move. One of the most useful components to teach the mBot to move in a certain way is to use the line follower module included at the bottom which detects if the mBot is on top of a line, or if it has gone left or right.

    "lessonAnalysis":"The way the line follower works is by detecting differences in light intensity between the path to follow and the rest of the surface.

In the mBot the line-follower sensor has two pairs of sensors that emit and receive infrared light. This design makes it easy to detect if the mBot is on the path or if it is going off it. Make sure you watch the video to see the table that includes the values obtained from the two pairs of sensors. Using these values, it is easy to determine if the mBot needs to turn left or right in order to stay on the line: if both sensors are on the line move forward (value 0); if the right sensor is off (value 1), turn left slightly; if the left sensor is off, turn right (value 2). Nevertheless we will have to come up with a strategy for the mBot to find the path if both sensors are off. In this case we will program the mBot to back up until it finds its path again. ",

In this first example we will simulate the behavior of a person driving a car. We will program the mBot to follow a path using the line follower all while its able to respond to an object in its path and a crosswalk (represented by a missing section in the path). While doing this lesson, we will review how to use  multiple components of the mBot from  previous lessons and implement programming concepts such as loops, and multiple conditionals. ",

Using what we know from using the ultrasonic sensor, we will program the mBot to detect objects while its moving and stop if there is something in its way. Using what we know from the values of the line follower we will adapt the original line follower code to react to a crosswalk that is represented in our circuit by a missing part in the path. ",

    "lessonPresentation":"After programming the mBot how to 'drive' we are going to implement a strategy that shows the mBot 'how to find a parking spot and park'. This lesson builds on top of the code from last lesson and uses the same components to figure out how to find a parking spot using the ultrasonic sensor and how to react to find a parking spot.",

    "lessonRequirements": ["led","line_follower","ultrasonic"],
    "lessonAnalysis":"Since this program is adding features to the Traffic Simulation program, most of the code for the line follower and object detection system has been written already. In this program we will implement a strategy to find an available parking spot in which the mBot will check for the right spot (Figure 17:B), then the left spot (Figure 17:C) and if none is available it will continue through the circuit until a spot becomes available (Figure 17:D, E). To implement the strategy to find an available parking spot it will require some engineering and trial and error testing to determine the amount of voltage over the period of time required to turn as accurately as possible since it is required for the mBot to turn 90 degrees to use the ultrasonic sensor that is located at the front of the robot. This number however can change as well depending on the charge of the batteries that are being used on the mBot and minor adjustments might be needed for the execution of the program. Once this number has been calculated we can use it to calculate the voltage per time needed to turn 180 degrees if the first parking spot is not available and repeat the 90 degrees calculations to return the mBot to its original path.
