    "lessonPresentation": "For this lesson let's review the software tools that would be used during this project including: mBlock, Arudino Mode, Arduino C. In this section of the project we would give a brief introduction to Scratch as a language, why it is easy to use and the different types of blocks that can be used in it to program different things. Here we would explain how to install mBlock, what version, from where and how to install it. We would include an introduction to the different type of blocks available in Scratch that are compatible with the mBot. However, the individual blocks explanation wouldn't go much into detail since each block would be better understood if its use is explained at the moment of using it, that way new users can see its practical application rather than only theoretical. Additionally, explaining what is Arduino mode and why it is useful would be included in this section of the project. Lastly, this section of the course would include how to connect your mBot to your computer and how to restore it to its original firmware if you wish to connect it to your cellphone. ",

The coding section is not too complicated but it is useful to show the first blocks in Scratch used to create a program, communicate with the mBot components and upload the program to the mBot using Arduino Mode. While doing this lesson we'll learn the first steps to create an mBot program and how to interact with the LED lights of the mBot. ",

In this lesson we will learn how to use the built-in-speaker of the mBot to play one of the most famous jazz phrases of all time: 'the lick'. While doing this lesson we'll learn about sound frequencies, how to interact with the built-in-speaker and a little bit of music.",

    "lessonAnalysis":"This lesson requires more than just learning about robotics. We will learn a little bit about music (the melody we'll play) and physics (note frequencies) as well. Make sure you watch the video for the diagrams of the music and the notes frequencies. However, don't worry if you don't know how to read music. The important thing is that you learn how to program the robot to use its speakers. The mBot can play notes from D0 to B8. If at the end of this program you'd like to challenge yourself try to play your own melody!",

    "lessonPresentation":"Now that we are starting to get familiar with the mBot and how to communicate with it to tell it how to use its built-in-speaker and LED lights, we are going to use a new component of the mBot and our first sensor: the light sensor. Using the light sensor to detect how the levels of light at a certain moment, we are going to program the mBot to turn on its lights and make sounds, an emergency mBot! While doing this lesson, we'll learn about conditionals,for loops, means, how to read information from a sensor and how to use that information in our programs. ",
    "lessonObjectives": ["Measure the available light", "Make a sound when the current light level drops 20%  below the normal light level", "The program will alternate blinking each LED in red and blue","Turn off the sound when the light level rises above the low-light threshold.", "Turn off the LED lights when the light level rises above the low-light threshold."],
    "lessonRequirements": ["speaker", "led", "light_sensor"],
    "lessonAnalysis":"The mBot has a light sensor on top of its circuit board that can be used to measure the level of light available around the robot. It returns a value in the range of 0-1024. However, these levels vary depending on the moment and room. For this reason, before we use the readings from the sensor, we have to calculate the mean of the readings. To do this, we are going to take 10 measurements of the light level each second and calculate its mean to determine the mean level of light. If the light varies from that level, then will tell the mBot to turn on its lights and make sound to work as a blackout alarm. ",

After teaching the mBot how to play 'the lick' its dream of becoming a musician has increased and now it wants to try improvising a little bit using the built-in-speaker and changing what it plays based on how far an object is using a new sensor: the ultrasonic sensor.  ",
    "lessonPresentation":"Now that we have dominated a few components and sensors is time to start teaching the mBot how to move. One of the most useful components to teach the mBot to move in a certain way is to use the line follower module included at the bottom which detects if the mBot is on top of a line, or if it has gone left or right. In this lesson new programmers will use multiple conditionals for the first time, and practicing their skills involving loops.",

      ,"The mBot shall execute a strategy to find the path if it strays off of the path."],
    "lessonRequirements": ["line_follower"],
    "lessonAnalysis":"The way the line follower works is by detecting differences in light intensity between the path to follow and the rest of the surface. Ideally, the path and the surface will have a lot of contrast to make it easier for the line-follower sensor to detect. In the mBot the line-follower sensor has two pairs of sensors that emit and receive infrared light. This design makes it easy to detect if the mBot is on the path or if it is going off it. Make sure you watch the video to see the table that includes the values obtained from the two pairs of sensors. Using these values, it is easy to determine if the mBot needs to turn left or right in order to stay on the line: if both sensors are on the line move forward (value 0); if the right sensor is off (value 1), turn left slightly; if the left sensor is off, turn right (value 2). Nevertheless we will have to come up with a strategy for the mBot to find the path if both sensors are off. In this case we will program the mBot to back up until it finds its path again. ",
