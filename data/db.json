We'll learn about sound frequencies, how to interact with the built-in-speaker and a little bit of music.",

      "analysis":"This lesson requires more than robotics knowledge. We need a little bit of music knowledge and physics. Watch the video for the written music and the frequencies of the melody notes. But, don't worry if you don't know how to read music. The important thing is that you learn how to interact with the mBot speakers. The mBot can play notes from D0 to B8. If at the end you'd like to challenge yourself try to play your own melody!",

Learn how to detect the light levels in a room, and we will program the mBot to turn on its lights and make sounds if it gets dark, an emergency mBot! The programming concepts you'll learn are: conditionals, for loops, how to read information from a sensor and how to use it in our programs.",

      "analysis":"The mBot has a light sensor that can be used to measure the light levels in a room. It returns a value of 0-1024. However, these levels may vary. Therefore, before we can use the readings from the sensor, we have to calculate the mean of the light levels. To do this, we will take 10 measurements of the light levels and calculate the mean. If the light goes below 20% of the mean, the mBot will turn on its lights and make sound to work as a blackout alarm.",

        "Learn how to create a Theremin using the mBot, a musical instrument that changes the note it plays based on how far an object is using a new sensor: the ultrasonic sensor.",
      "presentation":"The ultrasonic sensor is one of the most useful sensors integrated in the mBot and we are going to use it a lot in our next programs. It allows us to detect how far an object is ahead. It works similarly to a SONAR by sending an ultrasonic signal from one eye and receiving it on the other. Although humans can't hear it, the mBot calculates the time it takes to receive the echo and uses this information to calculate the distance in centimeters. We will use the ultrasonic sensor together with the integrated speakers to create a Theremin, an instrument that tells the mBot to play a tone that changes depending on the distance from an object ahead.",
      "objectives": ["The mBot shall play a tone when something is within 15-50cm", "If the object is out of range, (less than 15 cm or more than 50) the mBot will stop playing a tune", "The mBot will play a range of an octave based on equal spacing over the 15-50cm range", "Highest note will be played at 15 cm and lowest at 50"],
      "req": ["ultrasonic"],
      "analysis":"The first step to build the Theremin is to determine the interval values for the note values. The 15 cm mark will be the lower bound and will trigger the highest note. The lowest note will trigger at the 50cm mark plus a 6-10 cm cushion to make sure it gets played. First we calculate the range by subtracting the lowest end from the high end (50-15 = 35). Then, to index the notes we will use the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of a division. We do the following to index the notes: Subtract the minimum value from the range to scale the range down to the values we are interested in. Use the mod operator to get the remainder from dividing the range by the number of intervals. Subtract the remainder from the range. Perform the division to get the index. For instance: we begin knowing that our range is 15-50cm. To play 7 notes: 50 -15 = 35, 35/7 = 5. Each note would have a 5 cm interval. If the sensor returns a value of 15.72cm, we subtract the result of the MOD operator to convert the to an integer (15.72 - (15.72MOD5) = 15.72-0.72 = 15). Lastly, by dividing this number by 5 we can calculate a value that represents our note.",

      "title": "Follow the line",
      "description":"We will learn how to use the line follower, one of the most useful sensors to tell the mBot how to move.",
      "presentation":"One of the most useful components of the mBot is the line follower. By using a pair of sensors that point at the floor, the mBot is capable to determine if its on a line, or skewed left or right based on the light reflected by a signal. Using this information we can teach the mBot how to follow a path represented by a dark line.",
      "objectives": ["The mBot shall detect a path marked by a dark line.", "The mBot should be able to follow the path.","The mBot shall execute a strategy to find the path if it strays off of the path."],
      "req": ["line_follower"],
      "analysis":"The line follower works by detecting differences in light intensity between the path to follow and the rest of the surface. Ideally, the path and the surface will have a lot of contrast. In the mBot the line-follower has two pairs of sensors that emit and receive infrared light. This makes it easy to detect if the mBot is on the path or if it is going off it. If both sensors are on the line it returns a value of 0 which tells us to mean forward; a value of 1 means the right sensor is off  so turn left slightly; and a value 2 means turn right. Using these values, we can follow a given path.  Nevertheless we will have to come up with a strategy to find the path if both sensors are off. In this case we will program the mBot to back up until it finds its path again.",

      "description":"Using the line follower, ultrasonic sensor, LED lights and speakers we simulate the behavior of a driver.",
      "presentation": "For the last lessons we will combine all we have learned to create programs that are slightly more complicated. First we will simulate the behavior of a driver by using the line follower simultaneously with the ultrasonic sensor to react to objects in the path, and a stop sign (represented by a missing section in the path). We will review the multiple components from previous lessons and implement programming concepts such as loops, and multiple conditionals.",
      "objectives": ["The mBot will follow a path using the line-follower.","The mBot will detect objects in the path using the ultrasonic sensor and wait until the object is removed.", "The mBot will pause for a stop sign (a missing section in the path) and use the LED lights to signal a stop. After a few seconds it will be able to continue and find its path again"],

      "analysis": "This program is based on the code learned from the line follower lesson. We adapt it to respond to different events that could interrupt its course such as an object in the path or a stop sign. Using the ultrasonic sensor, we will program the mBot to detect objects and stop if there is something in its way. Using what we know from the line follower code, we will adapt it to react to a missing part in the path that represents a stop sign.",

      "req": ["led","line_follower","ultrasonic"],
      "analysis":"This program is based on the code written in the last lesson. We will implement a strategy to find an available parking spot in which the mBot will check the right spot, then the left spot and if none is available it will continue through the circuit until a spot becomes available. This strategy requires some engineering and trial and error testing to determine the correct speed and time required to turn as accurately as possible to use the ultrasonic sensor located at the front of the mBot. Minor adjustments might be needed for the execution of the program since speed and time vary depending on the charge of the batteries.",
